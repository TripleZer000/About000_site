					<h1>Story of TripleZer0</h1>
					<p class="siteSub">From TripleZer0, the man himself.</p>
					<p class="roleNote">This article is about TripleZer0, an autobiography.</p>
					<p>I <strong>TripleZer0</strong>, will tell you a true story. As best as i can remmember of how I came to be TripleZer0. Also a few intresting things in my Deep Web history.</p>
          <h2>Some Ordinary Gamers</h2>
					<p>It all started back in late 2016, I started wathching SomeOrdinaryGamer's Deep Web Browsing videos. I became addicted and wanted to view this deep web myself.</p>
					<p>I got in and started looking arround for some interesting sites. One that stuck out to me was Dans Chat. I became an active user in this chat as username: noone, as in no one. I wanted to stay anonymous like everyone else. I then messed arround a bit with my username to become none000.</p>
					<p>Barely a week or two into being there i found out a lot about the deep web. I also kept being called 000 or three zeros, as a nickname. So it needed to be tweaked again. I had decided on TripleZer0. After that username change i was invited to a new chat room of sorts.</p>

					<h2>EvilCorp</h2>
					<h4>Where evil lurks.</h4>
					<p>I was starting to enjoy evilcorps friendly users more than dans users. So within a month of being invited i made the change completely to Evilcorp. If you are new here EvilCorp is an irc chat. I made new friends and that is when i began coding as well. I became addicted to chat room. It was my life.</p>
        
          <h1>The Dreadful Underground</h1>
          <p>November 30th, 2017 was the day I uploaded my first ever website known as The DreadFul Underground to Dans Hosting. This site had everything. From conspiracy theories to a link list, containing 500+ active links(link list made by an old friend). 7nf5wkubzpodrezj.onion was its link and i am saddened because Dans lost all of its files at somepoint in time including mine. For the record, this link https://archive.4plebs.org/x/thread/20069592/, containing a vide which was hosted on my site at a point in time was but a joke. A joke that got attention i wanted to up the views on the site.</p>
          <h2>The Story Continues</h2>
          <p>This site and this story is to share my legacy</p>
          <p>I am humble to all who have helped me in my jorney, but I know it is far from over. Currently I am hanging around EvilCorp IRC, creating and helping others code projects.</p>
