<center><h1>Twas the Night Before Christmas</h1></center>
<center><p>By TripleZer0</p></center>

<p>'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through #lobby not a creature was stirring, not even a cat. The stockings were hung by MrRobot with care, in hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.The users were nestled all snug in their beds, while visions of chat danced in their heads. And Megatron in his terminal, and I with my beer, had just settled our brains for a long winter's break. When out in the server there arose such a clatter, I sprang from my code to see what was the matter. When, what to my wondering eyes should appear, but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer. With a little old driver, so lively and quick,I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick. More rapid than coders, his coursers they came, and he whistled and shouted and called them by name:"Now Dasher! Now Dancer!Now, Prancer and Vixen!On, Comet! On, Cupid!On, Donner and Blitzen!To the top of the porch!To the top of the wall!Now dash away! Dash away!Dash away all!"</p>

<p>And then, in a twinkling, I read in the chat the /ACTION prancing and pawing of each little hoof. As I drew in my head and was turning around, into the chat St. Nicholas came with a bound. He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot. A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack. His eyes--how they twinkled! His dimples, how merry!His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow. The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath. He had a broad face and a little round belly,that shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly. He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, and I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself. A wink of his eye and a twist of his headsoon gave me to know I had nothing to dread. He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,and filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk. And he /ACTION laying his finger aside of his nose,and giving a nod, up the chimney he rose. He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a /ACION whistle, And away they all /ACTION flew like the down of a thistle. But I saw him chat, 'ere he drove out of sight, St. Nicholas | "Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!"
